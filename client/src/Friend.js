      <h3>Bring a friend!</h3>
      <p>
        We would absolutely love for everyone to bring a friend. This is
        definitely a, "more the merrier" situation. All we ask is that you
        include them in your RSVP so we have a better idea of the amount of
        food, drinks, and chairs needed.
      </p>
      <h3>Make a friend!</h3>
      <p>
        It's been an isolating few years. We can all use a way to make some new
        friends and see some familiar faces.
      </p>
