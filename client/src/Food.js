      <h4>Food:</h4>
      <p>
        Vegan, omni, and gluten-free options will be available. Please let us
        know if there’s any other dietary restrictions! You deserve to be fed if
        you’re being invited!
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4>Drink:</h4>
      <p>
        Both a DIY bar and themed, pre-mixed cocktails will be on hand. All
        pre-mixed cocktails are virgin, so everyone can enjoy them in whatever
        way feels best for them! Plain, as a spritzer, or with liquor. Beer is
        BYOB, all else is supplied. Feel free to bring whatever you'd like!
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4>Dessert:</h4>
      <p>
        There will be a proper singing of "Happy Birthday", and
        fanning-out-the-candles moment. Briana is a brat and is expecting it.
        (Options will also be omni, gluten free, and vegan. Any additional
        allergies, just let us know!)
