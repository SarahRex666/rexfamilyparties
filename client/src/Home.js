        It’s officially happening! Briana turned 30 last September 13th. Being
        the month before the wedding made celebrating, at least in a big way,
        ultimately impossible. But now, one year later, we’ll be celebrating at
        her official Shrek-themed redo 30th birthday party.

        For those precovid friends of hers, you’ll remember the block party
        takeover parties. For the newer folks, let us explain. Every year our
        block has a block party that is always within a week of her birthday.
        Instead of celebrating a block party like normal people, we're doing
        this. Hence the block party birthday party takeover.
