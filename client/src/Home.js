        It’s officially happening! Briana turned 30 last September 13th. Being
        the month before the wedding made celebrating in a big way ultimately
        impossible. But now, one year later, we’ll be celebrating at her
        official Shrek themed redo 30th birthday party. For those precovid
        friends of hers you’ll remember the block party take over parties. For
        some newer folks..let us explain. Every year our block has a block party
        that is always within a week of her birthday. Hence the block party
        birthday party take over.
