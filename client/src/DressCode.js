        Come as your favorite Shrek character. The Shrek Universe is one that is
        large with very few limits. The characters, all the options, the
        mainstream movies, the made for tv shorts..and let us not forget about
        Shrek the Musical. The (hopefully) ever expanding Shrek universe has an
        abundance of characters for you to choose from and, of course, please
        reach out if you have any questions at all.
