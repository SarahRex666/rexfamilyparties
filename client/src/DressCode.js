        Come as your favorite Shrek character. The Shrek Universe is one that is
        large, with very few limits. The mainstream movies, the made for tv
        shorts, and let us not forget about Shrek the Musical. The (hopefully)
        ever-expanding Shrek universe has an abundance of characters for you to
        choose from! And, of course, please reach out if you have any questions
        at all.
