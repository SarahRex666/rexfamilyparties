      <h5>Folks with kiddos</h5>
      <p>
        You are always more than welcome to bring the family! There will be so
        many other kids for them to play with, along with the games and prizes
        the DJ gives out. Do what is best for you and your family. Gentle
        reminder that towards the evening things can get weird, but please don't
        let this deter you from enjoying the day together! We'd love to see you
        all! Outside of the actual block party activities, we will also have kid
        friendly activities and all drinks are virgin.{" "}

      <h5>Folks with doggos</h5>
      <p>
        Unfortunately due to the scale of how large this block party is, we ask
        that you don't bring your pup this time 'round. This is out of
        protection for both doggos (loud noises and stimulation) and the kids
        running around. Thank you for understanding, please don't hesitate to
        contact us to discuss!
